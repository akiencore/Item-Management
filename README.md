# Item-Management Application

An alpha version that totally originated by myself, and it allows me to test some Django techniques to setup MVC structure. 

## Purpose: 

To create an item management application that includes 2 tables: 
* Container
* Item
    
</br>

This application based on Django can manage item by:
* add containers into Container part 
    * containers have different ids and attributes to show differences between them
* add items into Item part
    * so as items have different ids and attributes
* do related searches to get information of an object by: 
    * id and attributes of items
    * where is the id of the container that has a specific item
    
</br>

## Environment settings:

* Programming Languages: 
    * Python
    * JavaScript

</br>

* Operating System: 
    * Linux

</br>

* Software Framework: 
    * Django (> ver 2.2)


## How to setup
1. copy all files into an empty directory
2. runserver with 
> python ./manage.py runserver
3. access localhost:8000 (default)
